## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Almost there! :heart:_

1. Click **Merge pull request**.

Make sure that you're on the `ci` branch in the page you're following instructions from._ Wait about 20 seconds and then refresh the page. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
